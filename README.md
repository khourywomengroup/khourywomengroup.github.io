## Resources
The group maintains several resources:

### Website

Link: https://khourywomengroup.github.io/

The website is made using Github pages and is simple and mostly static. The main purpose of the website is to gather all available resources into one place for easy access. A contact gmail for the group is maintained at ccisphdwomen [at] gmail [dot] com

### Mailing List

Link: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ccis-phd-women-group

The mailing list is used to reach out to all members of the group for announcements. Events organized by the group, along with reminders, are posted on the mailing list and members can use the list to communicate and share relevant events and other resources. Organizers are responsible for new member invites and moderation.

### Google Calendar

The group maintains a Google Calendar with all upcoming events. Organizers are responsible for adding events to the Google Calendar.

### Slack

Link: https://ccisphdwomen.slack.com/

The Slack team is used for chat and announcements. All events posted on the mailing list should also be posted on Slack. Slack has Google Calendar integration set up so reminders for events created on Google Calendar appear on Slack, but it is recommended to add events on Slack using Kyber as well, so that members can view upcoming events on Slack as well.
